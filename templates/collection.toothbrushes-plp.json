Don't forget to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth for comprehensive cleaning<\/li><li><strong>Timer Guidance:<\/strong> Many electric toothbrushes have built-in timers. Brush for the recommended time (usually two minutes) and let the brush pause or signal when it's time to move to another section of your mouth<\/li><li><strong>Rinse and Clean:<\/strong> Spit out the excess toothpaste but don't rinse immediately. This allows  the toothpaste to continue protecting your teeth. After brushing, clean the brush head thoroughly and store it properly<\/li><li><strong>Turn Off the Brush:<\/strong> After cleaning, turn off the brush and rinse your mouth<\/li><\/ol><p>It's essential to follow the specific guidelines provided by the electric toothbrush manufacturer for your particular model, as features and usage might vary.
