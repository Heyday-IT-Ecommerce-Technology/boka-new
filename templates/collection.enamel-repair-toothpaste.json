This is why many dentists now recommend it as a trusted alternative for daily enamel protection and oral health.</p>",

            "row_content": "<p>Both n-Ha and fluoride contribute to the remineralization of teeth. However, n-Ha is unique in that it mimics the natural composition of teeth. Unlike fluoride, which may only harden the surface, n-Ha helps reverse early signs of tooth decay, offering internal protection and relief for sensitive teeth. Additionally, n-Ha toothpaste is fluoride-free, making it safe to swallow and free from toxins associated with fluoride formulations. This makes it an ideal toothpaste for strengthening enamel.</p>",
